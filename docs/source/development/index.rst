Developing for Lightkurve
=========================

Lightkurve is an open-source, community driven package. We strongly encourage users to contribute and develop new features for Lightkurve. These pages first discuss the vision of Lightkurve, and then how to contribute Pull Requests on github for new features. These pages also discuss how to compile our documentation (including this page!) and how we release a new version of Lightkurve.
